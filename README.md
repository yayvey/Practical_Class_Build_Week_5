> This is a practical build for my Midterm, set up for the HW2 assignment.
> Now re-purposed to actually be used for my midterm.

## Midterm Team-Based GitHub Project ##

### Assignment Description: ###
> You will be building a 1-page app. Pick a subject that you can disagree with - both
> points of view should appear in the final submission. As an example, one person
> could argue that dogs are best, the other person could argue that in fact cats are
> WAY better than dogs. Create a simple page with images and text. Divide the page
> into two sections; the first section is arguing FOR, the second is arguing AGAINST.
> Create a conflict with your teammate before you get too far into the assignment;
> resolve it.
> Create a Github repo with a ReadMe file; push the project and submit the link.

#### Assignment Requirements: ####
> Use what we’ve covered so far (Terminal, Git and Github) to create a simple 1-page
> HTML application. A few paragraphs of text for each point of view and at least one image
> for each is required.
> One team member must create a repository on Github with a Readme. Add your partner
> as a collaborator. Put the appropriate information in the readme file (this will be basic,
> because it’s a simple 1-off).

> Each team member will create a branch and add their argument / position and image(s)
> to the app. 
> Merge everything to the master branch when you’re finished. Do code
> reviews before you merge.
> Push the finished files to your repo, double check to make sure you’ve merged
> everything to the master branch and submit the repo URL to the FOL dropbox.
